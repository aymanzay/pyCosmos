# pyCosmos
ML-based Recommendation system using pySpark and Directed Weighted Graphs

## Dependencies:
 - spotipy
 - PySpark
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - sklearn
 - graph_tool (for python; from graph-tool-2.27)
 - gym (from OpenAI)
 - matplotlib

## File Descriptions:
 - conf: contains required directories and variables to load and store required variables
 - spot-api: containing spotipy api to download full userâ€™s library given an input token, returned in a pandas df, saved to a pickle file.
 - dag: contains api for a directed weighted graph, including list transformation functions for graph compatibility.
 - schema_functions: contains the functions scheme requires to get data, fit/load models, etc.
 - sql_libdb: saves pandas DataFrame into SQL query-able database form for later automated recommendation purposes. 

## File Breakdowns:
scheme:
 - Uses pySpark to create Spark DataFrames for later clustering and graph construction.
 - Using spark-sklearn to convert Spark DataFrames -> Pandas -> Numpy arrays
 - Clustering is done using sklearn MeanShift, k-Nearest Neighbors.
 - Generate a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) from data recovered from clustering using networkx.
 - Plot the DAG representing user library schema; depicted in the three graphs below.
