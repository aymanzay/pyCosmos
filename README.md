# pyCosmos
ML-based Recommendation system using pySpark and Directed Weighted Graphs

spot-api - containing spotipy api to download full userâ€™s library given
an input token, returned in a pandas df, saved to a pickle file.

dag - contains api for a directed weighted graph, including list
transformation functions for graph compatibility.

scheme - uses pyspark to create Spark DataFrames for later clustering and graph
construction.
Using spark-sklearn to convert Spark DataFrames -> Pandas -> Numpy arrays
Clustering is done using sklearn MeanShift, k-Nearest Neighbors.
